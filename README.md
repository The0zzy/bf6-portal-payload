# PAYLOAD

This classic game mode is known from Team Fortress, Overwatch, CoD and many other titles.
One team needs to deliver the Payload to the target while the other team must stop it or even push it back.
Get close to the Payload to push it. The more players that push the Payload, the faster it will move.
Along the way there are checkpoints which will add additional time. Defenders can contest the payload and push it back to the last checkpoint.
Attackers win by pushing the Payload to it's final target before the time runs out.
